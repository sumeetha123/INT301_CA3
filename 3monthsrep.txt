Q) Use any open source software to generate your entire system's log report of past 3 months.

	Although there are many ways to find this with and without open source softwares, I used Logwatch to generate this past 3 months!

Steps to install logwatch:

	Sudo apt-get install logwatch 


Then the command that we use for getting report of past 3 months is:

	sudo logwatch –range ‘between -30 days and today’

With the help of this command, we can generate a report of range of past 30 days!
