To redirect this report to email,

First we need to update system package,
	
	- sudo apt-get update

Then we need to install Mail transfer Agent, in my system i installed postfix,

	- sudo apt-get install postfix

To check if it is properly installed,

	- sudo systemctl status postfix

Then the command we need to use to redirect report to email is,

	- sudo logwatch --detail High --range ‘between -90 days and today’ –mailto -s “Logwatch report” sumeethakota@gmail.com

This will help me to redirect report to email address mentioned!
