Q)Find partial and full multimedia files(video files) in DataStream

For this I used a tool called foremost!

Command to install foremost 
	
	- sudo apt-get installed foremost

create a directory with the name Datastream 

	- mkdir Datastream

View this with the help of ls command

The command that we need to use to view partial and full nultimedia files is, 

	- Foremost -v -t all -i <Datastream>

In the place of datastream we need to give the name of the file we want to recover!

Like,

	- Foremost -v -t all -i video.mp4


Here -v = It is verbose mode, this gives info about current state of the program and is highly recommended 
-t = timestamp of the current directory, so we dont need to delete the output directory for running multiple times!
-i = input file
